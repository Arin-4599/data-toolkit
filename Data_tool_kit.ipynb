        "\n",
        "1. What is NumPy, and why is it widely used in Python?\n",
        "   - numpy is a python library used to store data in array formate\n",
        "   - we use numpy as import numpy as np\n",
        "   - numpy is very fast and made by c language\n",
        "   - in numpy we use np.array(), np.asarray(), np.asanyarray()\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  How does broadcasting work in NumPy?\n",
        "    - Broadcasting is NumPy’s rule‑set for stretching (“broadcasting”) arrays with smaller shapes so they can take part in element‑wise operations without making explicit copies\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is a Pandas DataFrame?\n",
        "   - pandas is used to make dataframe by pd.DataFrame() in this dataframe we use index to denote data\n",
        "   - like 0-Arin , 1- ayush, in this we can make custom indexes\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  Explain the use of the groupby() method in Pandas?\n",
        "    - groupby >> splitting the data as per information like peoplr survived in tatinic\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  Why is Seaborn preferred for statistical visualizations?\n",
        "    - because it has more statistical plots\n",
        "    - it has more attractive plots\n",
        "    - it is based on matplotlib and it give high level interface for drawing\n",
        "    attractive graphic\n",
        "\n",
        "6.  What are the differences between NumPy arrays and Python lists?\n",
        "    - numpy arrays are store data in array form and like for eg:- array([1,2,3,4,5,6])\n",
        "    - but in python list they store data in format like [1,2,3,4,5]\n",
        "    - in numpy array all element are of same datatype but in list element can mix datatype\n",
        "\n",
        "7.  What is a heatmap, and when should it be used?\n",
        "    - A heatmap is a data visualization technique that encodes values as color inside a 2D grid (or sometimes over a geographic/graph surface). Darker, lighter, or otherwise varying hues let the eye spot patterns—highs, lows, clusters—far faster than numbers in a table\n",
        "\n",
        "8.  What does the term “vectorized operation” mean in NumPy?\n",
        "    - vectorized operation in numpy are high level array expression and loops that handel all expression execute in one go\n",
        "\n",
        "9.  How does Matplotlib differ from Plotly?\n",
        "    - matplotlib is data visualition techinque which make esay task more easier and hard task possible  it contain scatter plot, line plot, piechart, histogram, area plot\n",
        "    - plotly has little bit of tough syntax for eg:- it use fig = go.figure()\n",
        "    fig.add_trace()\n",
        "\n",
        "10.  What is the significance of hierarchical indexing in Pandas?\n",
        "     -  hierarchical indexing is a indexing in which a single index of dataframe have multiple index level\n",
        "     - it give selective silcing , easy reshaping\n",
        "\n",
        "11.  What is the role of Seaborn’s pairplot() function?\n",
        "     - sns.pairplot() it means make scatter plots with respect to all numerical columns\n",
        "\n",
        "12.  What is the purpose of the describe() function in Pandas?\n",
        "     - it give statistical information about numerical coloumn pd.describe()\n",
        "     - it give five point summary i.e:- min, 25%, 50%, 75%, max\n",
        "\n",
        "13.  Why is handling missing data important in Pandas?\n",
        "     - handling missing data is important because it give incorrect result , failed computation , because real world data is messay that why handling missing data is important\n",
        "\n",
        "14.  What are the benefits of using Plotly for data visualization?\n",
        "     - plotly chart are fully interactive it give all scatter, line , histogram,\n",
        "     barplot\n",
        "     - it give flexibility with little code\n",
        "     - it support huge varirty of code\n",
        "\n",
        "15.  How does NumPy handle multidimensional arrays?\n",
        "     - numpy handels multidimension array in form of matrix with rows and coloumn, like 3rows and 5column\n",
        "     - eg:- np.array(3,4) it will give multidim array\n",
        "\n",
        "16.  What is the role of Bokeh in data visualization?\n",
        "     - bokeh is used to create browser based visualization it is mainly good for large data\n",
        "     - it bridges the gap between simple static ploting and full blown interactive web dashboard\n",
        "\n",
        "17.  Explain the difference between apply() and map() in Pandas?\n",
        "     - they are used to transform data\n",
        "     - map() = used with pandas serease it do element wise transformation\n",
        "     - apply() = use with both serise and dataframe use with row and colouum wise operations\n",
        "\n",
        "18.  What are some advanced features of NumPy?\n",
        "     - numpy is used for converting data into array by using np.array , np.asarray , asanyarray(),\n",
        "     - nunpy is used in boardcasting\n",
        "\n",
        "19.  How does Pandas simplify time series analysis?\n",
        "     - pandas simplify time series analysis by time indexing and date indexing\n",
        "     - by shifting data, logging data\n",
        "\n",
        "20.  What is the role of a pivot table in Pandas?\n",
        "     - it is used to aggreate data and make data in more readable form\n",
        "     - to apply aggreate function\n",
        "\n",
        "21.  Why is NumPy’s array slicing faster than Python’s list slicing?\n",
        "     - numpy is made by c language and it is very fast thats why slicing is fast\n",
        "     - numpy store data in only one form thatswhy slicing is fast\n",
        "\n",
        "22.  What are some common use cases for Seaborn\n",
        "     - categorical data visulation is comman use case seaborn\n",
